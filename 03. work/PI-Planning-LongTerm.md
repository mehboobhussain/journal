#### Meeting Title:

Held on: 12-Apr-21 @ 11:56 AM

##### Key Points:
1.  Long term view of architecture 
2. 

##### Meeting notes
* Architects will support current and upcoming PI. However, we should have a longer term view so that we can understand the desired and expected landscape and prepare the right tools, technologies and solutions for it 
* Have a view of backlog items with priorities defined (if any)
* We should have a view of next 2-3 PI's. Right now we don't operate this way but we should. Otherwise, getting a futuristic view wont be possible. 
* Looking at the future PI's and backlog, the architects should assess the followings:
    1. Any risks that might hinder the goals and progress
    2. Any upcoming technologies that can help or enable the solutions or improve delivery
    3. Any seasonality based challenges or opportunities e.g. summer breaks, X-mas and Eid, etc. or any other major event that can impact work or solutions. 
    4. Any business challenges that EK can face or opportunities that we should avail in the coming PI's
    5. Any organizational change expected and how it can impact the solutions

Based on these aspects, propose the architectural recommendations for the architecture, product and delivery teams. 

I suggest we create a simple framework to carry out this work so that we could cover all aspects mentioned above. We can create a visual view of upcoming items leading to the desired landscape and a roadmap for it.
