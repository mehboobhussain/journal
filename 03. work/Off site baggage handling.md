# Off site baggage handling

System should know every bag that has been issued - Industry 
Physical handling of bags should be taken care by business

- When the bags are checked in these should be marked as not authorized to load.
- .D element in BSM which shows where the bags have been checked and how it will reach the airport
- Local issue
- MACS, BHS and BELT do not handle .D element that has been issued by IATA
- First scan can turn these into authorized bags
- BELT should show it as a red scan even if the bag is seen until the passenger is "seen" at the airport.
- Change in MACS to identify from TA that it is an off site location check-in.
- in future, industry could allow passenger could check in from home. print the bag tags and put these in a plastic envalop.
- we can also take as piece weight e.g. 15Kgs 
- 
- Check-in, baggage drop, police scanner, immigration, boarding gate / lounge / group.
- the challenge to identify when the passenger is on the airport
- .S element is not authorized to laod
