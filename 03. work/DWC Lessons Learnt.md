## DWC Lessons Learnt

1. Challenge for testing in non production as systems are not connected. Challenge in testing in production as IT is not supposed to create data in live systems -> involve business users. Identify users and testers early on, have a meeting with them and agree on the test plan.

2. Airlines masters done flow from DMIS -> Coordinate with all effected systems to make sure they have the schedule for the flights and the required masters created -> In future, DMIS to System should be automated to create masters.

3. MACS and SALT teams were not involved early on -> Check with all systems what is your dependency on the other systems and assess if they need to be involved and at what level.

4. Hold a meeting with business to cover end-to-end cycle and identify what needs to be done. In this case, SITA queues were not tested before go live -> create a to do list and assign tasks to IT and business users and have follow up meetings with business to be on track.
