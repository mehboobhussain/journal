BizzDesign - Metric creation 

1. Create a new container for the metrics in the model browser. To do this, add a new Motivation elements section to your ArchiMateÂ® model, and call it "Metrics" for example. This will give you an identifiable place for your metrics.
2. Add the metrics within this container. Do this the way you are normally used to. For example, right-click the new Metrics section and click New > Metric. Name your metrics.

3. Add a Metrics view to your model. In the model browser, right-click the folder in which you want to add the view, and then click New > Portfolio > Metrics view.
4. Click the newly created Metrics view to open it. The view is shown, containing an empty metrics table.
5. Click  to put the table in edit mode, and add the metrics to the parent axis of the table. Drag the metrics from the model browser onto the allocated area in the table, or click the plus sign in the allocated area, and select the metric of your choice
