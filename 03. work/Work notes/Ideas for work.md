Ideas for work 

Retrospectives On 06-Feb-21 

After every PI, we conduct session for Retrospectives. Team members share ideas on what worked well and what did not. I had been thinking about the followings: 
1.	Such learnings are recorded on a confluence page and these are not referred after that day. There should be some way to reference these learnings in a day to day work. 
2.	I am sure some of learnings could be useful for other teams so that they could avoid the pitfalls and enjoy benefits from other teamâ€™s experience. We should have some way to share these across the board.
