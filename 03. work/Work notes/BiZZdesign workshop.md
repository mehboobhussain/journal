    * It can be shared from Horizzon which can be used a dashboards and ad hoc reports as well
    * Colors and labels can be added, filters can be applied etc.
    * Workflow can be added on an object, that will be sent to the person assigned 

    MODELLING AND ROADMAPPING
    * Life cycle dashbaords can be built using Kabana. e.g. Application and technology Roadmaps 
    * Kabana can show how many applications are supported. How many applications are supported by an applications. How many processes an application is supporting etc.

    ANALYTICS
    * You can do a wild card search from the main dashboard of Horizzon
    * You can use spring diagram to see connected applications and objects
    * In studio, right click on an object and ask to generate the report (Ctl+G)
    * Used AWS symbol on a platform (probably an application symbol)
