## Role of Architects in PI Planning

### Pre-PI Planning

### Portfolio Collaboration
- Enterprise Architect to provide Architecture Roadmap by collaborating with Lean Portfolio Management.
- For new or ongoing initiative Architects to work with EA to draft the initial solution intent for the next PI.
- Discuss on the Technical Enablers with EA for the upcoming PI.
- Discuss if any specific Technical Debts for the upcoming PI.

### Team Collaboration
- Architects collaborate with Product Management to define these near-term work items and walkthrough the same to the feature teams in a span of one or two sessions.
- Architects collaborate with Systems team on the objectives and the tech transformation planned for next PI.
- They collaborate with teams to reduce discoveries during PI Planning and help ensure teams can make the necessary decisions during PI Planning activities.
- Create new Enabler features in Jira and communicate to the team during refinement. They provide feasibility insights that help define and scope current Features and their acceptance criteria for enabler feature.
- Provide the Solution Intent for required features.
- Architect mapping to features/domains needs to be published to the Teams.

### Product Collaboration
- Architects collaborate with Product Management to define and prioritize these near-term work items.
- Participate in planning, definition, and high-level design of the solution.
- Plan and develop the Architectural Runway in support of new business Features and Capabilities
- Architects also consider technical dependencies outside their AAT with other AAT and ET acting as a key collaborator in these Coordination

### Architecture Capabilities

- Consider product roadmap and define Enablers in the backlog for teams to explore and gain knowledge that ensures the future Feature’s viability.
- Support the team in breaking down Enabler features in to Enabler epics and stories.
- Identify tech debts and get them prioritized by working with Product Management.

## PI Planning

### Architecture Vision Presentation

- Architectural Objectives : Tech debt, Tech Transformation, Tech Enablers
- Technical Enablers - presenting the architectural runway. They explain, in business terms, how enablers and other technical work support their overall objectives (business value) and lobby for their need and importance
- Technical Debts - presenting the Tech Debts features add more insights on them.
- Technical Transformation - presenting the path to the Target state from an Architectural stand point.
- Best practices - solution best practices more specific to the product and AAT.
- Evangelisation of architectural values and other quality attributes.
- Highlight if any process changes in the ways of working.

### Team Planning Sessions
- In the breakout sessions, teams estimate their capacity for each Iteration and identify the backlog items to realize the features. Each team creates their plans, identify risks and dependencies and draft their team PI objectives.

### Solution Architect will
- Participate in the discussions and provide solution clarifications when required in the team breakout sessions.
- Help in prioritisation guidance to the Teams.
- Providing the opportunity for ‘just the right amount’ of architecture, avoiding Big Design Up-front and avoiding too much vertical drift
- Support the team in identify risks and dependencies and help in draft their initial team PI objectives
- Help the team with sharing the technical and architectural vision which could help in RAE (Relative Arbitrary Estimate) of the user and technical stories and prioritisation of them.
- As teams create their plans during breakout session, architects roam the room to ensure teams plan technical work properly and ensure they are accounting for the AAT Enabler work. (In electronic sessions, architects will be available for pull on demand basis)
- Architects helps in addressing the technical questions and concerns.
