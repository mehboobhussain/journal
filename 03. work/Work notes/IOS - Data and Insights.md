IOS - Data and Insights

Data Discovery
To be able to find out if the data is available in your organisation or not.
To be able to find out what is the level of data that is available in the organisation
That is the granularity of the data available in the organisation


Layers of data
The first layer of data will be used to forecast operations based on the past experience notes and inputs from other systems

The second layer of data will be used to simulate various operational scenarios using parameters to find out how the operation will change at every step based on the forecast data and the parameters

Once the simulated scenarios are available users should be able to easily identify which scenario is not visible and filter them out. That's hilarious which a feasible should then be considered for Optimisation

The Optimisation could be as simple as ranking or it could be based on various operational constraints to identify what is the best possible solution for various scenarios simulated in the previous Run.


Digital Playbook
All of these ideas about having the data forecast events, to simulate the scenarios and to optimise your operation can be imagine as a large Digital play book of events in the operation

The Playbook obviously has three parts oreva the three parts are not disjoint they are inter inter connected as well as integrated with each other

Digital Playbook should be able to play any scenario at any given time and provide options to the operational staff 24 cast what can possibly happen to simulate the best possible scenarios of recovery and to take an optimal decision based on the situation and awareness, parameters and operational constraints

Notes with Regina
There are few applications which are used by Service Delivery

Cat 360 - used for catering - this is the nerve centre of all the catering related activities including cost in buying spreading the operation for operating at cetera
Primarily this is caused this application however there are few revenue streams which are possible like ancillary revenue for example Cakes and champagne on board

Mail order device - this application is based on a Samsung phone and will be used to take orders from the customers on board about their means. This will be used to identify what kind of means have been Ordered and delivered to the customers and identify the wastage of the mail by comparing the meals availability what is the main demand.

R3S - this is Emirates high speed application which is used to track the sales of Duty free on ground as well as on board

RMS - the application is used to manage duty roster of the ground resources

Paradise - paradise is an HR application for the crew. Is not only used to review the performance of the crew but also used for any incident management

BMS - briefing management system - this application is used to brief true about their journey the requirements the configuration and expected load and the expected requirement about the passengers on board at cetera this also indicates which breathing room the crew has to use and how to get there

TMS - trainee management system track all the equipment and the training room facilities for providing pilot training as well as through training

KIS - kis is primarily used to take data about passengers behaviour incident demand and observations on board which is then passed to Casa for their analysis. The information is also passed to a KFC what them to plan the means better next time

K i s is going to be used for on Board registration of frequent flyers, late baggage hummer upgrade of seed et cetera
Emirates holidays data will also be joined to kiss because currently we do not know the passenger who is sitting on board has booked any holidays or not I got this information will be very useful if joined with other passenger profile to serve them better

Service Delivery have recently reorganized and created a new team for Data Analytics and they want to use the federative federated approach
They are taking various initiatives in the space of business intelligence for through training to sickness etcetera the dashboards are based on the data from kiss which are used to track these activities

Primarily the business intelligence related applications and models have grown organically in the past however the new team which will be late by Melvin there will take a Holistic view of the entire business intelligence work program and identify a landscape to see where do they want to reach in next 2 years

The idea is that all the decisions made in Service Delivery should be driven by data so they want to create a business model which is given by data instead of people got feeling of intuition

This will help Service Delivery to spend the right amount money on the right portfolio and write projects

Will be also very interesting to see if the group profile is connected with the customer experience and it is expected to bring lots of inside by comparing the customer insight customer experience and the type of through which we had on board

Currently there are 26000 crew in Emirates Airlines and total spend is around 4 Billion dreams
