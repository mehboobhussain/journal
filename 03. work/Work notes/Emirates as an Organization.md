Emirates as an Organization 

Some aspects to consider

- 18 individual control centre – not well connected, information flow is poor – example ??
- Duplicate functions – example baggage handling, flight controllers and flight officers and NCC
- Expertise in one department not being extended to others
- Similar of Duplicate functions / systems / - examples ??
- Organization produced tera bytes of data without any capability of analysing it, learning from and improving the processes?
- Senior managers with very small teams – should be an exception
- No audit of business benefits after the delivery – why spend time on creating business cases. Or it should be monitored by BFMs
- Synchronization between planning and operations
- Synchronization among operational departments – create a master plan for resources, operations and peak seasons, etc.
- From idea to delivery is 2.5 years typical cycle. Why PRB is just once a year activity? Why can’t it be on need basis? Like a workflow where people vote for the best projects without physically meeting?
- Functional split has caused too many areas of specialization. To carry out one simple task, you need 4-5 teams involved
- IT systems – must be smaller number with defined objectives and smaller module to plug in and out
- Documentation is huge, hard to understand and difficult to manage, this should be digitized where one could query about the system like a Wikipedia which should be updated as part of the development / enhancements
- Linear and water-fall approach takes too much time to deliver
- Cloud computing is untapped – why to keep such huge infrastructure for non-production environment?
- Useless documentation, no search tools available, documents are not updated and are out of synch from the real systems
- Too many meetings, sometimes no actions out of these, Most meetings are one hour. Most involve traveling results in wasting time
