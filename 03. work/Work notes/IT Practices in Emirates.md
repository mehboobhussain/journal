## IT Practices in Emirates

- ITCPR - presentation of project status to senior mangers
- CMDB - A central repository of all applications, their owners and components
- Project office with guidelines on SharePoint
- Application service management
- Relationship management role to be close to the customer
- Business analysts to understand and document the findings formally
- Induction programmes to bring all new staff on board quickly. Should be applied for l roles.
- Weekly stays reports - summerised all the way to top management. Published in shared mode.
- IT service desk to centrally record and resolve incidents and problems.
- ITSR to requisition of material from IT stores, to label them and track these.

### Things that worked
- Change control board to prioritize the enhancements - PM, Business owners, BITM
- 1-2-1 meetings with PMs once a month or once a week as appropriate
- PMs to update status to the stake holders directly
- Catch up sessions with stake holders and business users to update info and take their inputs
- Outlook tasks with priority and date (desc), today/this week/someday
- Keep important documents and minutes of meetings on SharePoint
- Minutes of meeting in email / during meetings
- An air tight mechanism to follow up tasks
- Project review every month/week, PM to present various dimensions of the project
- Use of BAs and SBA effectively to get the real requirements and provide effective solutions
- Use google calendar and email for private tasks/events. Bring these on the phone with office tasks

### So many areas to improve though
- Why do BITMs approve ITSRs for application access?
- Why do SOWs take so much time from initial discussion to final approved SOW document?
- Why does it take 60-90 days to hire a resource for the projects?
- Why there are so many iterations in UATs before these are accepted for production promote?
- Why there are do many bugs when a new application is launched?
- Why it takes so much time to promote a functionality after it is fully tested and approved to go live?
- Why do we spend so much time answering emails and attending meetings?
- Can we have a clear KPI for each job role that get updated on an ongoing basis like rating of cricket players. This could be reviewed weekly.


- Agility - too process bound and not ready to see value in simple and quick solutions.
- Mindless standardization on Java. Using ONLY JFoundation library for all projects.
- Useless innovation team. Far away from the real issues. Never brought any real innovation. Configuring emails on iPhone is considered as innovative whereas it's a standard feature.
- Mindless security processes. Instead of providing secured solutions they tell you why you cannot do it.
- Project documentation an overkill, specially for support and enhancement projects.
- No way to simulate real situation before promoting applications to production. Test and UAT environments don't have right data to check if system will work. Should have a lab to simulate.
- Application testing with regression test packs (automated) is missing.
- No tools to track user requirements, application bugs and promote history.
- Portfolio management tools missing. All such reports are done manually. Project central is partial help but can be made better.
- In general creativity is hard to find at any level. Generally not encouraged.
- No library or manuals to improve staff productivity. No IT magazines so staff is not aware of latest developments. Everyone spends hours to learn the same things. E.g. Features of MS Office and other tools.
- No showcase of IT systems or equipment. If you want to see how a particular system works, you have to track the right people, request for demo etc.
- No quick prototyping tools to find what exactly us required by users. Requirement gathering and solution design processes are manual and rudimentary.
- Users cannot report and track bugs, issues with the system. Although they can use IT service desk to launch the complaint but there is no visibility after that.
- IT does not have a central place to find out brief information about various systems. what they do, who takes care of them, who are the users etc.
