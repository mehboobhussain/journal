## Thinking ahead

- How are things today and how these should be tomorrow
- What if the limitations do not exist, what if with some magic, the restrictions are removed, then how things should work?
- What, when, where, why and who
- What categories of the issues exist? Which region or area has the most concentration, does it change with time? hours,Â morning evening, day of week, months, season, peak time and down time etc.
