Suppliers can view and update product information. This is available for items that are associated with the suppler on an Approved Supplier List.
Suppliers can also maintain any inventory that is either vendor managed or consigned. These are two different types of inventory and should not be confused.
This enables the supplier to search by item and see all the orders associated with the item, as well as performance information such as Overdue orders, Defects, Returns, and On Time indicators for deliver.
Suppliers can also maintain any inventory that is either vendor managed or consigned.
