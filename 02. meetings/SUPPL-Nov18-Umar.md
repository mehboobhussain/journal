Prep
1. Can we park the iSupplier concept for a while and try to come up with an overall solution scenario
2. Lets imagine an ultimate solution to the problems - considering time, money and effort no bar
3. How will the solution help the organization and its key benefits
4. How will the processes work? right from onboarding to retirement
5. What will be the large blocks of data needed by Finance
6. Data blocks needed by others
7. What data is essential as soon as the supplier is on-boarded? that can continue forever.
8. Storing data forever ? price of maintaining supplier vs benefits of having the data
9. Where we can more information about iSupplier 
10. A model go in phases or steps to implement the ideas
11. Reporting back to steering group

Minutes

1. There should be a single place to register the supplier regardless of the entry point
2. A supplier can be engaged via an RFT process, or a direct contract or even a direct invoice without any other engagements. Therefore, the solution should register the base set of supplier information [to be discussed in detail] before any further processing
3. Should we register suppliers who have not even responded to RFT? In an ideal world yes - there can be suppliers who have not responded to any of our RFTs ever and they can try to pitch themselves as partners
4. Should we keep record of suppliers even after stop doing business with them? Yes as the relationship might had been stopped due to legal issues, quality issues, SLA issues or even a ban that was placed by some external entity. If we simply remove these suppliers, we might make wrong decisions in future engagements
5. We would like to store the key events that lead to break-up of relations, risks involved, a summary of communication and observations, legal aspects, etc. This information can be helpful in legal matters
6. Supplier should be able to register themselves (via a portal, an app, etc.) by providing the required basic details. This can take the work off from Emirates to register a supplier. This can also act as first line of filtration or assessment
7. In a scenario where Emirates needs to stop all interactions with a supplier, there solution should provide a toggle to switch off and on (with a reason) and all related processes and systems should be able to refer to this state before making any interactions with the suppliers
8. We have a mature process for customers to whom we provide services. A similar process should be put in place for the suppliers who's products and services we are going to consume. 
9. Umar will share the work done on iSupplier so far, where it was stopped and possible reasons. 
10. Working group will find out if iSupplier fulfills the desired solution state or how much it fulfills. Working group will also highlight benefits (or drawbacks) to implement iSupplier showing if the benefits are only short term or long term as well as what will be the coverage of the solution. 
12. Working group will also create a discover document to have all the study, analysis and rationales of the decisions taken. I will initiate it and all members of the working group will contribute in this living document. This will be updated as we progress in the initiative.
13. I will create a slide desk based on the discussions and will submit it on the team site by Sunday 22-Nov. This will act as the basis for our discussions and the slide pack will be refined so that it could be distributed to stakeholders if needed.
