Held on: 15-Apr-21 @ 09:09 AM

##### Key Points:
1.  
2. 

##### Meeting notes
* Converted reports are stored as a meta data in the schema of Orbit
* Connectivity is done using JDBC client
* There are 2 schemas for Orbit, one main schema and other staging schema
* Schema can be migrated to a stand alone database
* If this is within the same subnet, then connectivity and performance are okay
* Security package has to reside on EBS to handle the seeded content
* XXFO schema has to be part of EBS and cannot be decoupled
*
