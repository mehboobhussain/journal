## Initial write up on the topic of Supplier master 

- JIRA Write-up from Katie.
    [Log in - Emirates JIRA](https://jiraagile.emirates.com/browse/ERPART-143)

    **Overview:** As a prerequisite to iSupplier and iProcurement global implementation the Supplier Master Data needs to be analysed and a structure agreed with Finance and P&L to ensure we have one aligned central source of Supplier Data moving forward.
    There is some overlapping data where both P&L and Finance have an interest and they are aligned when there is a contract in place, however, there are suppliers P&L would record who are not successful in a tender and equally some suppliers Finance pay who are outside P&L with no recorded contract.
    Analysis on a Supplier Master Data architectural structure is needed to ensure on-going data integrity and to enable iSupplier and iProcurement to be rolled out more widely.

    **Key Focus of activity:**ï¿½Architecture will drive the creation of a data architecture with engagement with business areas. Resource needed from FINPL should be low as mostly discovery and analysis with execution to follow in a later PI with the team

    **Customer Value:** Ensure data integrity and alignment to enable iSupplier and iProcurement to be enabled more widely bringing efficiencies from centralising suppliers, removing manual scan and upload of invoices and removing tech debt from Agile/DMS by enabling core ERP capabilities
