### Meeting prep
    > Do not get involved into too much technical details
    > Keep POC of passive a parallel activity
    > Try to resolve known issues
    > Offer to FIN that we will make 5 reports work

### Meeting notes
    > Technical 
    - Requested Oracle to provide info about Discoverer objects (1200 views)
    - We can provide access to the known areas where business is expected to run the reports

    > Business issues
    - Business will think that we are trying to handover something to business that we know will not work.
    - Although the phase for running the reports is a later one, but IT will address all possible known issues

### POC
    - Preferred approach is to go with active and address passive later
