Notes:
Single point of entry into the enterprise, preferably by the suppliers themselves
More systems in the overall view
View with only one entry point
in iSupplier view, let the iSupplier take central stage with the services to all stakeholders
Zycus is end of life and can be taken away
180 suppliers are already registered 
iSupplier can do registration, issue purchase order, acknowledge purchase order, invoice payment, etc.
Currently, we are just using the invoice payment part
We have not enabled all PO based suppliers but can be done
