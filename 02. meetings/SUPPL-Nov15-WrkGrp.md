##  Title: Working group meeting on supplier master
    Participants: Umar, Fiona, Tej, Katie

### Background:
    - Notes about topics discussed but no action is required

### Meeting Discussions**
    1. Currently the supplier data is a collection of disconnected islands which makes it difficult to manage the supplier
    2. However, it is hard to identify any losses or process delays in terms of dollar values of time value as no such study have been done or data collected
    3. Steering group asked to have holistic and connected view of suppliers across the entire organization
    4. We should have a supplier master data repository including suppliers we deal with in the past, we are dealing with now or the potential suppliers 
    5. Systems and processes developed so far were always to find a solution for a specific business unit. Therefore, these are not integrated 
    6. We should first develop an overall view of the supplier master that will act a central source of supplier information regardless of business process 
    7. We should study the capabilities of iSupplier in detail to assess what it can or cannot do from the point of view of this overall solution
    8. We should also collect data (at least high level blocks) about the suppliers which is needed by P&L, Finance, Audit, Engineering, Outstations, etc. 
    9. We should identify common data elements for current and future use
    10. We should develop a phase wise approach to implement the overall vision'
    11. Deliverable for now are 
        1. Overall vision / solution with architectural model 
        2. Major data elements
        3. Implementation approach 
        4. Capabilities of iSupplier

### Action items
    - [ ]  Who will do what what and by when

*Side notes
    - A single point of entry for all suppliers, even if never deal with them
    - cover potential suppliers and also the ones whom we are dealing with
    - also the ones whom we are paying but they are not
    - All systems we have are for a specific stakeholders
    - Delays in process and risks that we are not managing the relationships with suppliers
    - Payment might not align with the contracts
    - difficult to quantify
    - will we get some money or not? Probably not
    - Articulate the requirements -
    - if we map out vision, architecture will be part of the vision. Single alignment with the vision and we can think about phasing
    - concern is - this discussion is from 18 months
    - as an example finance suggested - iSupplier
    - end state will be a single repository across - iSupplier can be the first steps - no big bang - start with PO supplier -
    - research and investigation
    - agree on the vision, proposed approach - iSupplier gaps in the capabilities
    - when we are ready we can roll out with the steps, we can take our first step
    - vision + supplier master data elements + capabilities of the iSupplier
    - Scope of the iSupplier is a phase of the development
