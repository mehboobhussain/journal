[Key points]
    1. Explain the background - steering group asked for a central supplier master
    2. Did they ask for the life cycle management or not? Probably no
    3. We need to build an overall view of the supplier master
    4. Communicate with suppliers as a one stop solution. What is our initial scope?
    5. Is Oracle iSupplier the right step in this direction? 
    6. What can go wrong if we go with iSupplier

    Meeting discussions
________________________________________
    * In addition to iSupplier only, we should also include 2 other features to cater for PO based supplier
    * ERP Roadmap - life cycle management a bit further in the roadmap
    * We can implement this part of iSupplier but we are going in the right direction
    * How best we can set the roadmap of iSupplier and how can we implement optimal
    * How much effort is required to implement
    * Maximize the iSupplier model what they got today. 
    * Fiona wanted to fully use iSupplier 
    * What features are included in the iSupplier and are these Okay with the business
    * What is our T-Shirt sizing for the implementation 
    * Phased roll out rather than all features in one go 
    * Data clean-up exercise should be done
    * iSupplier is a portal, it is not a master data management tool
    * iSupplier is a channel to create the data 
    * From the unification point of view, we need a bigger discovery
    * Is the unification possible?
    * Anything with contracts is created through Zycus, all purchases related suppliers are created through ERP Finance.
    * Oracle has some master data management (MDM) solutions but iSupplier is not the solution
    * Michael was keen to consolidate the master data across the organization
    * ERP should be single source of truth in the organization
    * Normally these system has connectors - even Zycus should be able to integrate
    * Oracle will have a ready-made adopters. How we obtain those adopters and how
    * Ultramain and Zycus should integrate with the MDM
    * Even Ultramain send transactions to ERP, every system sends info to ERP
    * We have to look at the upstream activity - ERP is not the source of truth. For few suppliers only. Integration with Zycus is lost. 
    * if we bring Oracle MDM into the picture. Near technical integration.
    * We need to look at the overall ROI. Why are we looking at the short term gain by implementing Zycus.
    * We should have a short term view and long term view. But we can a longer term view as well.

>>DONE> Create a simplified architectural presentation for Supplier master data
            > stating the need to cover a single source of truth for the suppliers
            > What steering group asked
            > What iSupplier can do
            > What we actually need - a single source of truth
            > What else we need - life cycle management of suppliers (later, once we have sorted out supplier master data)
            > Who will be the ultimate master of this data? Finance or Procurement
                > All systems and process are aligned to ERP solution for all supplier related transactions
                > Finance should be considered the owner of the data
                > Procurement is stand alone but should integrate with ERP for suppliers
            > Ask Oracle what solutions they have for managing the master data (MDM)
            > Ask Oracle what solutions they have for integrating supplier masters with other systems Zycus, Ultramain, iDoc, etc. 
            > Build a roadmap of the solution phases
            > Do a T-Shirt sizing of the phases
            > Add the life cycle management to the end
