# Meeting Prep
* Use of BiZZdesign - we have the Yammer and COP site now
* We have used dashboards and APM landscape model quite successfully
* Few architects took interest and had a 1-2-1 with me and started using the tool but most have left already
* The tool has other strong points and we are paying 1m AED per year

* Active encouragement from AAT's or EA's not observed - so what is the approach
	* One way can be to go back to EA-Sparx and upgrade to the latest version (15) with the ad-on tool for dashboarding and clean up the repository.
        * Move repository to xxx and use Microstrategy to build the dashboards and roadmaps
        * Use Gliffy to model as it is embedded in Confluence
        * Use a C4 tool like structurizer 
	Other one is to keep going the way it is going

New focus group for documentation. One principal, less textual and more modeling. Modeling tool is important.  Sujith will announce and I will join in
