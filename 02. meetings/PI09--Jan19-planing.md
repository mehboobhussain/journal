    1. Prep for the meeting - specially on ERP interface remediation, Concur expense management, Uniform app tech debt

    Meeting notes
_______________________________________
    . Joyal added information about the ERP upgrade related remediation. 
    . GL Inquiry has a technical debt database on 11g 
    . Looking forward - taking off Discoverer from production should be planned in PI-10
    Took down this item - SUPPPFM-207 Support Services: Application Support
    
    [Suggestions]
    . We should present the PI plan linked to the business priorities. 
        Priorities linked to goals -> Epic -> Features
        Business should be able to track ask vs. Plan
    . Architecture related activities to be presented as a header / footer and team's activities as sprints

    1. Use the business backlog (high level) in JIRA with priority. 
    2. Create features and Epics and connect these with the business needs
    3. Create stories etc as usual
    4. Create a dashboard that shows how features will realize business needs
    
    .  What are the dependencies - whom do we need to carry out arch work
        - DBA team for war room related recommendations
        - GL Inquiry upgrade and other performance improvements
    
    .  What are the risks involved - check out for Architecture
        - Supplier master scope - life cycle management should not be included, else discovery scope might go beyond PI-9
