### Meeting Title: Orbit delivery escalations
    Meeting on   : 31-Mar-21 

#### Key points & Prep:
1. Charn escalated the delays in Orbit to Alex, we need to respond 
2. Provide a clearer picture, right communication, score and agreed date 
3. Get out of this reactive mode 

#### Meeting Notes
**_Go live of Orbit_**
    The root cause of the confusion and problem can be:
    - Lack of a visual plan with dates and agreed scope 
    - Lack of proactive communication to business
		
    The solution obviously is to:	
    - Visually define a timeline with the agreed deliverable
    - Define where the deviation took place and what was the new date
    - What was the reason for the change, what triggered the change
	
**_APPS Schema took time_**
    - We were asked by the DBA team not to use the APPS schema as it can compromise security of the ERP system. Alternate schemas were used but were not effective. The delay was pointed out by the business, we worked with the vendor, DBA, cyber security team, to clarify vulnerabilities and made it work. This took x week of time.
	
**_Non-ERP reports_**
* Initially Orbit recommended to install a package in 4 non-ERP systems (TRIPS, Kaleyah, CFO and Impact). DBA raised concerns over the use of this package. An alternate solution was also found. However, now DBA confirmed there are no concerns and we can go ahead with the work. We will install the package and make Orbit ready for non-ERP systems within a week.
