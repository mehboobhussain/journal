### Key points & Prep:
1. Walk through the roadmap and get the buy in 
2. Receive feedback and incorporate in slides 
3. Identify next steps

### Meeting Notes
* In the roadmap slide, first step is implementation of iSupplier
* Within step 1, supplier portal implementation will be in phases. First within FIN and P&L and then with other departments
* Use of supplier portal for all supplier master data. There should be one entry point in the organization
* This will be a difficult step and we will need setting up processes and communication with the stake holders
* This should be implemented in phases (FIN and P&L first) and then other departments
* Respective stakeholder will be engaged by business and date of transition will be announced in advance
* We will be able to use the capabilities of the sourcing and contracting system for life cycle management of the supplier
* Implementing Supplier Hub and Lifecycle management should be in parallel
* Indicate what we will be able to achieve after phase 1, 2 and 3
* Next steps after the steering board approval will be Implementation plan and estimated funds required 
* Phase 1 will be driven more by Finance, phase 2 is more technology and Finance and Phase 3 is more for P&L
* We can remove analysis and reporting or modify it to indicate we will be able to support auditing and reporting 
* Ensure that all concerns in current state and the challenges screens have been addressed in the desired state (step 3)
* We may not have clarity on the timeline right now, so we will not include timeline in the presentation
* No hurry to go to the board, we can do that in April
* However the slides will be shared with some stakeholders now to get their feedback and buy in
