_My description for the bucket - sent to RV:_

Based on the criteria given in each bucket, I can be in SME bucket as I am regularly consulted for advice by Scrum masters, Product Owners, release train manager as well business. I have strong skill set of design and architecture. 
However, Leadership Potential bucket seems to match my profile even better. I have demonstrated leadership behavior in multiple scenarios, ready to take up greater challenge and more complex role, have always taken accountability to ensure success, have shown passion and energy.

* We should create a overall view of what we want to do in PI-10
* Look into Architectural intent for all the initiatives
* All architectural decisions should be defined in the ADR
* Backlog refinement in JIRA
* Architecture runway for next 3 PI's even if it ambiguous
* Show runway in JIRA instead of confluence
