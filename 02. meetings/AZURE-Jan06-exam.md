    Best way to prepare
________________________________________
    I found a video on YouTube on how I passed Azure Fundamental exam. He
    explained that he watched videos of Tim Warner. He also prepared using MS
    Learn site.

    Udemy course was ok but not great as it did not show actual screens of
    Azure portal and tools, so don't waste time there.

    What problems I encountered
________________________________________
    Most I didn't have knowledge about networking and services
    I prepared mostly from Udemy where should have used MS resources
    Most questions had 3-4 parts and each one had a point, 
    so questions are more complex than simple yes/no, or with one straight
    answer
