    Meeting notes
---------------------------------------
    * Performance testing requests are received but we do not many people in the team to support it.
    * Need to get dedicated resources for it. Start date for it is April which is a bit late 
    * We have not been able to give enough attention to test automation primarily due to lack of resources
    * We also need to fix test strategy and approach issues
    * Raised a risk and Alex is aware of it
    * There are various tools for functional testing - Load runner is used for load testing and performance testing. 
    * Some of the scripts are available for ERP applications. With slight modification we can use those scripts. But converting scripts for all the areas need a considerable amount of effort.
    * HR Module were tried successfully in the past. Scripts are available for other areas of ERP application. 
    * UFT is the tool set
    * Common challenge is not the tool and tech stack. What to automate and where to automate is the challenge and not the how to automate
    * To get to that objective, we need to assess the efforts for the level of tested and which areas to be tested
    * Some budget has been approved for recruiting and trying to bring forward the recruitment
    * My preference is to get the resources issues sorted
    * We should escalate the point so that it gets the right amount of focus
    * Functional flows and list are in place. 
    * We do not force the tools to the teams and we let the teams choose the tool by themselves. What are your pass / fail conditions, what will be your approach to the test
    * We have a test strategy training
    * What about version management - instead of field ID we used field name 
    * Design practices have been improved and design patterns used can solve some of the version
