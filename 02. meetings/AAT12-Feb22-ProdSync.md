# Meeting notes
----------------------------------------
* How are we going to drive the ERP roadmap 
* There was a 10 year roadmap for EBS. EBS is here to stay 
* Separation of concerns
* Involve business and ask for their inputs on roadmap
* Every bolt on is going to be rationalized
* Self-service options for HR Direct, 
* We need to put in place one pager - so that business does not think IT is spending money and nothing is coming out
* HR Direct Light - needs a solution discovery. Everything does not need to go to EBS?
* What are non-EBS areas? How can we rationalize self services of HR Direct
* Roadmap for year 2 - has to be looked into
* SSO has to be sorted for HR Direct?
* Can BPC fund swift? Provide estimate for EFT remittance
