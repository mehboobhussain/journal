## Orbit deployment update to Charn
Related to: [[Orbit deployment]]

### Meeting prep
    1. Security guidelines about Orbit schema 
        Agreement with Orbit on implementing security guidelines
        Orbit will provide scripts to grant minimal privileges required
        Support team will implement these withe help of DBA team
    2. Running of reports 
        1. Access on Discoverer views - Oracle provided a list of views - IT will grant access on the relevant views (FIN and Payroll)
        2. Access to execute a package - This will be done as part of on-going support
    3. POC for passive site access
        Suggestion to go with active site for now.  Passive site for reporting is a great idea but there are unknowns, so not wise to keep it on the critical path of the project. This will be done no later (before June) after thorough testing. Right now go with active - plus monitoring 
    4. Orbit confirmed that their set-up confirms EBS 12.1 and 12.2 upgrades
        In future, when Oracle issues a new upgrade, a due diligence should be carried out. 
            However, all versions are backward compatible - it is likely to work
            Oracle will intimate for a major restructure
            Orbit will intimate for any structural change
        Our support team should be able to resolve if there is any issue

### Meeting notes
