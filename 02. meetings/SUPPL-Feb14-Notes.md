# Notes from iSupplier documentation

### Purchase Order Collaboration:
Oracle iSupplier Portal enables suppliers to view purchase order detail, such as terms and conditions, lines, shipments, and attachments. When a suppliers navigate to the Purchase Orders page, they can view all of their purchase orders.

### Shipment Notices
Oracle iSupplier Portal enables suppliers to create both advance shipment notices and advance shipment billing notices that alert the buying company of upcoming shipments. Oracle iSupplier portal also allows the supplier to expedite receipts and payments for the buying company. Suppliers can create shipment notices online or use a spreadsheet to upload shipment notices.

### Invoices and Payments
If buying companies have implemented Oracle Payables, suppliers may submit invoices online based on purchase order lines that they have fulfilled. Suppliers can create invoices against open, approved, standard purchase orders, or blanket releases that are not fully billed. They can also enter a credit memo against a fully billed purchase order as well as invoice against multiple purchase orders

### Inventory Management
Suppliers may easily access and view information about products the buying company provides. Using item numbers, suppliers may also view demand forecasts and various transactions. Suppliers can also maintain certain item information, such as manufacturing and order modifiers

### Supplier Management
Suppliers register their companies as a prospective vendor in Oracle iSupplier Portal to let their buying companies know that they are interested in establishing a business relationship. After supplier companies are registered, additional supplier users within that company can be registered to access and use Oracle iSupplier Portal.

### Supplier Profile Management
Supplier Profile Management enables suppliers to manage key profile details that establish or maintain a business relationship with their buying company. This profile information includes address information, names of main contacts, business classifications, banking details, and category information about the goods and services suppliers provide to their buyers.

### Buying Company View
The buying company user view in Oracle iSupplier Portal provides the same view of procure-to-pay transactions as the suppler view. Using the Internal User View responsibility in Oracle iSupplier Portal, a buying company user can view order, shipment, receipt, invoice, and payment information. Buying Companies may also search for information across all suppliers as well as respond to supplier change requests
