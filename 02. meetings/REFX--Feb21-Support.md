## Meeting notes
________________________________________
* Application is for leased assets
* SAP is completely managing it
* We do not have expertise in SAP (App, Infra or Architecture)
* The application gets data from our GL for accounting info and exchange rates
* SAP is a cloud based SaaS based set up 
* How are credential are managed
* Only few users in EK has access to it
* The interfaces have been in use and are working fine 
* Interface with Oracle is a minute part of the upgrade
* SAP will take the backup, they will carry out dev environment, EK will test and verify, it will be moved to production
* We can check firewall, connectivity and data exchange issues
* We cannot comment if the effort are worth doing a procedure 
* During RFT we negotiated what features are not required for EK
* What business is asking -> Is there any way to reduce the cost of work from SAS? Can we (IT) actually assess it?
* 
* We keep getting queries on upgrade or security related items
* The time was spent discussing the failed transactions
