Key points:
    1. Oracle offers Supplier master data management and Life Cycle management. Do we want to cover the both of just master data? 
    2. If Oracle meets Zycus replacement criteria in similar cost range, it can possibly provide a homogeneous solution resulting in cleaner landscape and uniform technology
    3. What should be the course of action to conclude the discovery within a month or so?

    Meeting notes
________________________________________
    * iSupplier is a natural way to go from here
    * We can leave life cycle management for now
    * Oracle (Fusion) is not as rich in functionality is not likely to come up as the top contender
    * Show the common database, common application and portal that are serving the business and suppliers
    * What is in phase - supplier submit their invoices, or PO based suppliers and master data management? 
    * Full scope of functionality is a better approach. Communicate with suppliers as a one stop solution. What is our initial scope?
    * We should be clear what is the scope?
    * We don't want to communicate with suppliers again and again. We need to milestones. What is required to switch on the module. Not only the invoice posting. 
    * We need to have efforts and timeline to configure supplier registration. 
    * We should be able to get estimates of having supplier registration as well as invoicing to start with
    * iSupplier needs to go on the backlog. We will take a wider view of the iSupplier.
    * List of features that business needs (use cases). Simplify into a road map
