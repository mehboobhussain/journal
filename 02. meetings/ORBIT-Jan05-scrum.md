    > Business is okay with the potential risk
    > Out of 1000 reports of discoverer, 600 will be converted to Orbit

        The U turn is due to business not accepting to change architecture
        Orbit might work with active site for a period of time but
        it should be moved to passive eventually. There should be a plan
        around it
