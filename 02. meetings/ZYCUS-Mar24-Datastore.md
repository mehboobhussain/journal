## Meeting Title: Meting on Zycus data
Meeting on   : 24-Mar-21, Related to: [[Zycus replacment]]

### Key points & Prep:
1. How do get the data from Zycus, store it on a vault and transmit to Jaggaer 

### Meeting Notes
 We can either have an ftp server or can have a SharePoint site. The URL can be exposed to the incoming vendor and they can tar/zip the file with a password and store the data. We will then disable their access. Next we can enable outgoing vendor and they can take the data and we close the SharePoint site. 

### Actions!
**Mehboob:** Explain this to Fiona and make her the owner after discussing with Joyal and Katie first
**Support:** Follow the instructions and get the site created and manage the contents etc.
