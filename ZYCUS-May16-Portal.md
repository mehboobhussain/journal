Transaction's  processing of supplier
where we have contracts in place, goods issues, returns, key processes, paying invoices, 
across Oracle, 16000 suppliers that are paid 

Currently iSupplier is being used by 200 suppliers 
we will extend the use of iSupplier for PO based invoices - 1600 (5% of spend it covered by purchase order)
if there is a PO, and he sends invoice, he is paid without involvement from Finance

iSupplier will be extended to all suppliers who has purchase order - from 200 to 1600. What to do for the rest of 1500 suppliers. 

Supplier to have potential to have business with Emirates - Once they register on iSupplier after the contract is. 
There is a better functionality in Jaggaer - is much better supported. These suppliers might not do business with Emirates. 

As soon as they are registered after the contract - 3000 to 3500 such suppliers - will come through procurement 
there will be 12000 that procurement will not know about it.

Everyone going through the assessment and evaluation, Jaggaer.

POTENTIAL - probably will never go through to the point of contract
