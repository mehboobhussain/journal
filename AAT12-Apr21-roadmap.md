##### Meeting notes
Notes from meeting with Chandra
    * Custom software developed by IT in AAT13. Merene is the TPO. Finance group it AAT13. Applications like Agile DMS is also in AAT12. Approval flow of invoices is done in Agile DMS.  
    * This functionality can move into ERP after 12.2, some business process change is possible. Park it for the upgrade. We can start a study now. Bolt on teams look for such a functionality. Rationalization of these bolt on is the next aim.
    * ERP Leave application will be released to all the employees so SSO is an enablers. SSO work has already been started. Ultimately it will use Oracle SSO solution. Mobile access management will enable users to login to ERP lite (workflow approval). 
    * First the enablers have to put in place and then bolt on and other applications can be taken up.
    * Two new teams are coming up - ERP skilled people with one PO and scrum master. Systems and functionalities may be coming from AAT13 to AAT12.
    * Build PI-11 and PI-12 roadmap and discuss with Katie from architectural point of view. Ask Katie if she needs to develop a runway for architecture .
