Article - A balanced metamodel

Defining a metamodel

### What is the main idea
- A balanced approach to define a metamodel for the organization - one size does not fit all

### Rough ideas - 3 Teddy bear story 
- Going by the book - get a full Archimate metamodel - looks great but tough to implement 
- Too simplistic, quick to draw and start but does not give the rich context to the stakeholders
- Home grown - try, adjust, adopt

### Who is the audience - who will read it?
- Business and Enterprise architects who are interested to define or fine tune a pragmatic metamodel for their organization

### Details
- What if you Adopt Achimate metamodel as is. How does it impact you in short, medium and long terms
- What strict is the governance around the usage of metamodel?
- What if the metamodel is too simple. It will provide a very high level view and some stakeholders might even like it specially business stakeholders. However, due to lack of details, it will become difficult to communicate with the technical stakeholders e.g. solution architects and developers. 
- How to find a balance
	- Assess how much information is available in the organization 
	- Identify the sources of the information and how reliable these sources are 
	- How much can the input be automated? Can it be refreshed every week, month or quarter
	- How many people are there to experiment with the initial model 
	- How much support from the chief Architect or CTO you will get to experiment
	- Things will go wrong so plan and be ready to back track 
	- Who will consume the model, where will you start
	- How much time you will spend on creating examples
	- What will be the impact of the metamodel on the architectural modelling and design
	- What benefit this will provide to whom?
	- Which objects the organization is really interested in?
	- What are the common challenges and common questions that needs to be answered
	- build a model and try to answer some questions - how many can you answer
	- Review of the model, adjust
	- Create examples models using metamodel or part of it - cookie cutter and cookies
	- Select how many model out of 23 standard templates you will use
	- Be consistent with the terminology - avoid confusion 
	- How many cycles of adopt and adjust are sufficient before this is published as a baseline model
	- How to implement governance around it
	- This is adoption of the model - create awareness, get buy in from business, IT stakeholders
	- Review and make changes quarterly if needed but assess the impact before publishing the new version
	- What about models that were created with the older version of the model
