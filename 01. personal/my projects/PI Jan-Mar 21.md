In Retrospect
Although I did not practice as much typing but the new mechanical keyboard encouraged to type more and it helped me to speed up a bit. So I generally achieved 50wpm. Although I am not perfect in touch type and occionally have to look at the keyboard

Moving up to 60 push ups was not that hard but doing it everyday was. I feel like not doing it at all. Most of the days I had to force myself to do that. It takes just 2 mins to finish and another 2-3 minutes to bring the breath to the normal level. 

Reading was not achieved. I mostly listened to the audio books and you tube channels. So need to improve in this area.

Same is the case for writing. Although I wrote detailed meeting notes that helped me in the office, but I could not make myself sit and write essays and articles. There seems to be some sort of blockage that I need to overcome. May be I need to read the book "Show your work" again. 

Speaking of that, I must write the summary of what I had learned, what I want to get from this book, where will I use it and when will I use that knowledge. 

From help perspective, I did help people in office and called up people in the time they needed a phone etc. I can sure improve in this area too. 

The budget was tight so not much of a charity was done. However, I restarted the Akhuwat charity of 200 AED once again. 

Worked closely with Sunaina and helped her to go on sugar free diet. She lost about a kilo but long way to go. Helped to get a new laptop and plan the work in advance. She needs help in many areas though. 

Going forward, I should continue to work in the areas where I have achieved well but should focus on the areas which I could not touch at all or could not do much. For an example writing every day is a great skill to have. This should result into a series of blogs that I should share using blogs posts and connect that through my other social media to gain some traction. 

All of the above should be considered when setting up target for the next PI which will start from 1st of April and will go till 31st of June 2021.
