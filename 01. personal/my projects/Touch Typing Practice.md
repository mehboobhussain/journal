#### Touch Typing Practice
_Websites to learn typing from_
www.10fastfingers.com

#### What helped
1. Trying to stick to the baseline - middle line with fingers on f and j
2. Trying to type accurately than fast - increases speed and accuracy
3. try to see the next word and anticipate 
4. try to type a word than a letter - focus on full words and build memory muscles for typing full words like mountain, milk etc. without thinking  
5. Say - relax ...calm down before typing, good posture helps 
6. Practice regularly, it is just like physical exercise
7. Practice. Practice. Practice...
