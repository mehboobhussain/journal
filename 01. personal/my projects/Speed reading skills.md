    - **#1 - Increase number of words for the same time - practice using Impetus app**

        Read a new text for 2 min, mark start and end point - recall
        Repeat 3 more times and each time try to increase the number of words read by going beyond the end point of the last read. 
        Read new text for 2 min and recall - Note down the improvement in speed

    - **#2 - Read same amount of text in shorter time - practice using Impetus app**

        Read a new text for 3 min with 'normal' speed - recall
        Read the same text or more in 3 min and recall
        Read the same text in 2 min and recall
        Read the same text in 1 min and recall
        Now read the new text in 1 min and recall - Note down the improvement in speed 

- **Tips and Tricks**
    1. Reading in Urdu is much faster for me. I can read 600 wpm. I should analyze what makes me read faster in Urdu and apply the same concept on material in English
    2. Spend a lot of time in reading - 30 to 60 minutes every day. It becomes rewarding once number of pages per sitting start increasing. Don't give up at initial boring stage
    3. Everyday, do a practice reading with the purpose of improving speed and comprehension. Keep it separate from day-to-day normal reading. Normal reading speed will be lower, it is ok.
    4. Always use a finger or a guide to run through the line. Slide the card down the page.
    5. Do not go back if something was not clear - keep reading. It is like watching a movie, you will catch up eventually. Go back, if you really missed a critical concept. 
    6. Imagine each line is divided into 3 parts - read one line in 3 stops, practice it and then try to read the line in 2 stops
    7. First sentence of the para often explains what the whole para is about - read first para slowly, imagine what can come next and read the rest of the para faster
    8. Pick up key words and key concepts from each line and join them mentally
    9. Try to skip alternate lines - while coming from line 1 to line 3 just glance line 2 just to get what is the concept or glue words that will connect line 1 to 3
