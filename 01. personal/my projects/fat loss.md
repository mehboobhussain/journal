#### Fat loss project - experiment on self

I started working on a self designed fat loss program since 12th of Feb 2021. This is primarily based on keto diet but it is not exactly keto or we can say this is a relaxed keto, where entering into ketosis state is not the objective at all. The objective is to lose weight (primarily fat). 

##### Food
As food plays 80% role in any fat loss or weight loss program, I am consuming as less sugar as possible. No direct sugar is my aim. This also means that, I will avoid foods that can quickly turn into sugar e.g. rice, roti, pasta etc. 

Looking at the results, I have lost about 7 kgs in a month. Here are some statistics:
Initial weight = 89.9 Kgs
Fat percentage = 21%
Muscle mass    = 32.4%
Push ups       = 20

In about a month the statistics changed to:
New weight     = 83. Kgs, 6.9 Kgs lost
Fat percentage = 19.8%, 1.2% lost 
Muscle mass    = 33.2%, 0.8% gain 
Push ups       = 50

##### Food routine
In general, I aimed for 60% fats, 25% protein and 15% carbohydrates. 

*Breakfast - around 12pm*
	- 2 Fried eggs with beef strip (40g) fried in butter
	- Avocado 100g
	- Black coffee with Cinamon powder, fennel seeds, 1 clove
	
*Lunch*
	- 7 almonds, soaked and peeled
	- 2 cucumbers
	- 1 Gauava
	- Walnuts 20g
	- Coffee / Tea with milk and sugar/honey
	
*Dinner - around 8pm*
	- Daal(lentil) gosht(meat) or vegetable with meat OR
		Salmon with Salad
	- Pan fried chicken breast 110g

##### Exercise
I used to military press with 40 Kg weight x 10 reps. The bar is placed in my balcony. As the weather changed and summar approached, I found myself getting discouraged to go to balcony even in early mornings. 

So, I started doing push ups. I used to do push on and off in my life so I could start this with 20 push ups even on the first day, although with some difficulty. Slowly I could push myself doing more in one go and within a month I was at 50 push-ups in one go. This is not the best exercise, but its not bad either. 

##### What next
Well, I want to achieve 79kgs before mid of April along with 80 push ups in one go. On 27th of March, I am 60 push ups which means I am making a good progress and likely to achieve the target. 

To reduce another 4 Kgs, I will have to struggle a bit as losing initial 7 Kgs were not as difficult as the next 4 will be. Hence, I am working on reducing further carbohydrates and increasing my protein and fat intake. The profile that I am targeting before Ramadan is:

Next weight    = 79.0 Kgs
Fat percentage = 18.5%
Muscle mass    = 34% 
Push ups       = 80

It is difficult to reduce weight in Ramadan, so my target will be to get through the fasting month with the same weight as I enter into the month. So a 79 Kgs 3 days after Eid will be my goal for now. 

Once the month of Ramadan is over, I will see if I can take my weight to 75 Kgs with the body fat about 17% and muscle mass up to 35%. 

##### Then what?
Once I achieve that weight and body profile, what should do? continue to diet and exercise the same way? If I do, I might lose further weight which I really do not want. If I let myself lose, there will be chance to gain all the weight back again. So, what should I do then?

That will really be a good problem. Once I am there with the body profile that always wanted, I will probably focus on maintaining it with but this time switching to more alkaline food. So the ultimate plan will be to achieve:

Body weight    = 75 Kgs
Fat percentage = 17%
Muscle mass    = 35%
Push-ups daily = 100
