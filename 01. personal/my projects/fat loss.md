#### Fat loss project - experiment on self. Updated: May20-21

I started working on a self designed fat loss program since 12th of Feb 2021. This is primarily based on keto diet but it is not exactly keto or we can say this is a relaxed keto, where entering into ketosis state is not the objective at all. The objective is to lose weight (primarily fat). 

##### Food
As food plays 80% role in any fat loss or weight loss program, I am consuming as less sugar as possible. No direct sugar is my aim. This also means that, I will avoid foods that can quickly turn into sugar e.g. rice, roti, pasta etc. 

Looking at the results, I have lost about 7 Kgs in a month. Here are some statistics:
Initial weight = 89.9 Kgs
Fat percentage = 21%
Muscle mass    = 32.4%
Push ups       = 20

In about a month the statistics changed to:
New weight     = 83. Kgs, 6.9 Kgs lost
Fat percentage = 19.8%, 1.2% lost 
Muscle mass    = 33.2%, 0.8% gain 
Push ups       = 50

##### Food routine
In general, I aimed for 60% fats, 25% protein and 15% carbohydrates. 

*Breakfast - around 12pm*
	- 2 Fried eggs with beef strip (40g) fried in butter
	- Avocado 100g
	- Black coffee with Cinnamon powder, fennel seeds, 1 clove
	
*Lunch*
	- 7 almonds, soaked and peeled
	- 2 cucumbers
	- 1 Guava
	- Walnuts 20g
	- Coffee / Tea with milk and sugar/honey
	
*Dinner - around 8pm*
	- Daal(lentil) gosht(meat) or vegetable with meat OR
		Salmon with Salad
	- Pan fried chicken breast 110g

##### Exercise
I used to military press with 40 Kg weight x 10 reps. The bar is placed in my balcony. As the weather changed and summar approached, I found myself getting discouraged to go to balcony even in early mornings. 

So, I started doing push ups. I used to do push on and off in my life so I could start this with 20 push ups even on the first day, although with some difficulty. Slowly I could push myself doing more in one go and within a month I was at 50 push-ups in one go. This is not the best exercise, but its not bad either. 

##### What next
Well, I want to achieve 79 Kgs before mid of April along with 80 push ups in one go. On 27th of March, I am 60 push ups which means I am making a good progress and likely to achieve the target. 

To reduce another 4 Kgs, I will have to struggle a bit as losing initial 7 Kgs were not as difficult as the next 4 will be. Hence, I am working on reducing further carbohydrates and increasing my protein and fat intake. The profile that I am targeting before Ramadan is:

Next weight    = 79.0 Kgs
Fat percentage = 18.5%
Muscle mass    = 34% 
Push ups       = 80

It is difficult to reduce weight in Ramadan, so my target will be to get through the fasting month with the same weight as I enter into the month. So a 79 Kgs 3 days after Eid will be my goal for now. 

Once the month of Ramadan is over, I will see if I can take my weight to 75 Kgs with the body fat about 17% and muscle mass up to 35%. 

##### Update on May 20-2021
I could not achieve 79 Kgs before Ramadan. In fact I was about 83-84Kgs area. Most of it was due to a relaxed attitude on the food and not sticking to the plan. 

Anyway, decided to reduce during Ramadan with just food and without any exercises. By the end of Ramadan I was:
Next weight    = 80.0 Kgs
Fat percentage = 17.8%
Muscle mass    = 34.2% 
Push ups       = Zero

During Eid holidays, I went back to 83 Kgs due to Eid parties and sudden change the sleeping and eating routine. After Eid, I tried to shed weight by restricting to calories < 1000 per day which worked. This is not a permanent solution so I will have to regularize my diet. But I have achieved 80.5 Kgs mark which I am trying to reduce further to 79 Kgs. I started military press 40 Kg x 5 reps x 3 sets. I am doing long walks whenever possible too. However, I plan to start push up routine again. I will need to work hard to build the push up routine from 20 to 100.


##### Then what?
Once I achieve that weight and body profile, what should do? Continue to diet and exercise the same way? 
Well, I have now set up a new target for myself that I plan to achieve in the next 3 months. Which means by the of Aug-21, I should have the following profile:

Body weight    = 74-75 Kgs
Fat percentage = 17%
Muscle mass    = 35%
Push-ups daily = 100

I will probably also focus on maintaining it with but this time switching to more alkaline food. So the ultimate plan will be to achieve:
