##### Use the lens power that is less than perfect
Usually, we go to the opticians or a glasses shop that have machines to identify what is the perfect lens power that you need to read correctly even the last line of the eye test chart. 

Once done, they suggest you a fine pair of lenses and a good looking frame. You pay and get the new glasses for yourself. As the world looks much brighter and clearer, specially while reading books or looking at your mobile phone, you will happy and relieved. 

But this the beginning of a down hill journey where your eye sight will get worst as time passes. Everyone including you and your doctor will say this is perfectly normal and you should get your eyes checked and replace with more powerful lenses as you age. 

The question is....is this really normal or there is a way to regain your eyesight somehow?

##### Search for the solutions
I stumbled upon a website where some wise guy was discussing exactly the same problem and he, luckily, had some suggestions that made a lot of sense to me. So I decided to take a plunge and do an experiment on my eyes to see if I can improve my vision or not in say 6 to 12 months.
