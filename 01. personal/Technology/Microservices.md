    - The concept came from the service oriented architecture
    - Microservices are smaller than general services - single responsibility to solve only one problem
    - Every microservice will have its own data and its own database. it is ok to have some redundancy

    - Cloud computing and cotainerization make microservices very simple
    - More microservices make a complex landscape more complex though, so be careful and keep a way to explore
