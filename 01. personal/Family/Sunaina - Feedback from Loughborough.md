Sunaina - Feedback from Loughborough 

Sunaina - Feedback from Loughborough University

Mr. Simon
* Draw people in various shapes and forms and behaviours
* Write blogs on serious art sites about critique and ideas on the art work
* Investigate on the animation characters like Mr. Freeze
* Sunaina should write emails to Mr. Simon for any questions that she might have or ideas about art

Miss Melanie
* Study Design Philosophy in depth
* Write blogs on your own work and others
* Discuss with students and groups
* You performed better in the groups and not so much as an individual
* Often get back to the teachers and validate your understanding in plain English to ensure you are doing the right thing
* Sunaina has a flare of being an art teacher


Observations and discussions
* Sunaina is good at ideas and she ask quality questions
* Sunaina is good at writing about art so she must use that skill further 
* Failing in first year, although a set back, is not going to impact the overall score
* This year can be compensated by not doing the sandwich programme
* Sunaina should get help from student support and get herself assessed for autistic traits. If autism is found, then the university is bound to provide help in examinations and assignments 
* Sunaina should be aware of her limitations and should form a strategy to avoid setbacks due to these
