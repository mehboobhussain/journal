* Breath normally
* Walk on the natural pace, let group split and then join at the rehderation breaks

* Eat well, otherwise weakness makes you tire quickly. Eat well at dinner as well but not too much.
* Walk with hip and not with knees
* Take a sharp lookout at the changing situation, fellow team members getting sick or uncomfortable. One person's problem will impact the whole team
* Discuss with the team and assess the situation before making any decisions, weigh pros and cons, discuss with guide
