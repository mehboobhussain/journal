#### Keep physically and mentally fit

###### Physical fitness
- Try to reach 100 push up daily
- Military press and Squats
- Reduce weight to 75 kgs 
- Reduce usage of reading glasses

I started the [[fat loss]] project to achieve these targets
	
		
###### Better eyesight
- To get rid of reading glasses altogether or 
- reducing this to 0.25 so that I don't need the glasses most of the time

With my current number of 2.0+, it is an ambitious target. So better to break it down to smaller achievable steps by running a medium term project [[better eyesight]]
	
###### Mental health 
- Sharpen memory
- Stay organized
- Medicate and stay calm
