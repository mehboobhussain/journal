### Goals that I want to achieve 
* Advance [[career]] 
* Stay [[health]]y
* [[gain knowlege]]
* Improve [[skills]]
* Contribute to [[society]]
* Help [[sunaina]]

I will initiate some [[@my projects]] to reach these goals. The projects will be time bound and their description will contain resources required, ideas to implement the projects and some high level steps. 

These projects will be executed in program increments or PIs that will run for a quarter. Each PI will be then divided into sprints of one week duration to define and track the targets. 

Currently running [[Current PI]] and will change this as I go 
The ideas flow into [[@Someday]] and then into [[@@Today]] lists where the actual execution takes place.
