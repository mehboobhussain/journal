## Book - Atomic Habits 
by James Clear

changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=157))

With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=158))

four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=193))

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=284))

“That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.” ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=300))

But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=327))

Mastery requires patience. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=336))

“valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=344))

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=359))

Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=370))

True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=402))

Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=411))

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=480))

Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=485))

True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=486))

The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=508))

Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=554))

Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=570))

“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=575))

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=613))

When the context changed, so did the habit. ([Location 1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1189))

Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1479))

Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1484))

We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1543))

Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1670))

When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1716))

If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. ([Location 1730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1730))

Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. ([Location 1733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1733))

simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1750))

Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. ([Location 1911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1911))

Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1912))

The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2044))

Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist. ([Location 2046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2046))

Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. ([Location 2328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2328))

We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. ([Location 2548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2548))

Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator. ([Location 2552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2552))

Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor. ([Location 2732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2732))

FIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge of just manageable difficulty. In psychology research this is known as the Yerkes–Dodson law, which describes the optimal level of arousal as the midpoint between boredom and anxiety. ([Location 2785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2785))

really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. ([Location 2812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2812))

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. ([Location 2853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2853))

Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2855))

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery ([Location 2876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2876))
