Book - Reading with right side of the brain

Technique is more important than brute force.
Results don't come from inspiration or motivation, they come from practice
Building good habits is hard but rewarding
Start small and build up on skills 
Be patient with the progress. Never hurry up to lift more, run longer or do more too quickly. Injuries cause very long delays.
