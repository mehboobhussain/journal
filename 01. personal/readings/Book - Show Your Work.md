Book - Show Your Work

## Book - Show Your Work! 
by Austin Kleon

### 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
1. Share your thoughts and your process and your work, online, for free. 
2. You don’t need to be an expert to share your work - beginners can easily help other beginners. 
3. By sharing your work online, you’ll attract an audience of people who care about the same stuff you do - this can change your life. 

# 🎨 Impressions
This is one of the three books that most changed my life (the others being ‣ and ‣ ).  
It completely changed the way I thought about sharing stuff online, and encouraged me to start my blog in January 2016. 

## Who Should Read It?
I think this should be required reading for everyone in the world. If you’ve got an interest in creativity (of any sort) or entrepreneurship or business (of any sort), you should stop reading this and just read the book. 

Even if you don’t have the slightest interest in creativity, entrepreneurship or putting yourself out there in any capacity whatsoever, you should still read this because it’ll open up neural pathways and possibilities that you never knew existed. 

It also takes less than 30 minutes to read, so you’ve got no reason not to. 

### ☘️ How the Book Changed Me

How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.
- It made me more comfortable with sharing my thoughts and my work online
- It made me generally more comfortable with putting myself 'out there'
- It made me start my blog
- Starting the blog was the first step to starting my YouTube channel a year later, and the YouTube channel changed my life

### ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes
- Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing
- Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time
- The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, and video. Take people step-by-step through part of your process. As blogger Kathy Sierra says, “make people better at something they want to be better at”

### A new way of operating

The world has changed. It’s no longer enough to just *make* stuff and hope that people find it. You have to be *findable.* 

Think of your work as a never-ending process. You can share your process in a way that attracts others. 

> Imagine if your next boss didn’t have to read your résumé because he already reads your blog. Imagine being a student and getting your first gig based on a school project you posted online. Imagine losing your job but having a social network of people familiar with your work and ready to help you find a new one. Imagine turning a side project or a hobby into your profession because you had a following that could support you.

> Or imagine something simpler and just as satisfying: spending the majority of your time, energy, and attention practicing a craft, learning a trade, or running a business, while also allowing for the possibility that your work might attract a group of people who share your interests.

> All you have to do is show your work.
