### üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences
Sorry, I couldn't manage 3 sentences. Here are 3 points. 

1. Take *Literature Notes* when reading. Highlight stuff and write down stuff that resonates with you. Try to take these notes *in your own words*. Yes, you might just be paraphrasing from the text for its own sake, but the extra effort is worth it. 
2. When you've finished a book, go through your *Literature Notes* and create *Permanent Notes* from them. Write exactly one note for each idea, and write as if you're writing for someone else. Use full sentences, include references. Don't just capture ideas, develop them, remix them, contradict them. Make *Permanent Notes* that are relevant to topics you're working on, or subjects you care about. 
3. Add your *Permanent Notes* to your *Slip-Box.* File each one behind (or under) one or more related notes. Add links to related notes. And make sure you can find your notes later, by linking to them from your index, or from your topic notes. 

### üé® Impressions

This book has transformed my relationship with note-taking. I took copious notes while reading it, and everytime I review my highlights, I discover new nuggets. 

I'd say it's a *must-read* for anyone who reads a lot. If you don't read much (books, articles etc), it'll still be useful (because you definitely consume some sort of content). 

If you're a student, and all you care about is maximising your grades, it probably won't be too relevant. But if you care about learning for its own sake, rather than to just pass the exam, then you'll love it.
