### Architecture modeling tool
Spent considerable time to find a low cost or free tool to carry out architectural modeling.
Most of the tools are either too expensive or lack the essential capabilities. For an example very few tools support Archimate. Most are focused on UML and BPMN. Tools like Archi support Archimate very well but lack the support of any other modeling technique. 

Few years back, I purchased EDrawMax because that was the only modeling tool available on Mac that was reasonably priced. If I was a Windows user, I would have certainly gone for EA Sparx. When I switched from Mac to windows, I found the perpetual license not working any more. I contacted their support team and explained that I purchased a perpetual license thinking that I will not need to buy the license again. Ever. But that is not how their sales and support team thought. Long story short, I was out looking for another tool that has a lower price tag and covers most common modeling techniques. 

After some struggle, I stumbled upon draw.io. As it developed as a web application, I thought it won't work for me. But then I found a Windows application version. After installing it I realised that not only it is a free tool but also it's amazingly simple to get started. So started with a simple use case diagram that I could complete in 15-20 minutes. 
Encouraged with this experience, I went for more templates. The tool had almost all kind of modeling templates I could wish for. Archimate, UML, BPMN, ER diagrams,etc. I could draw the models,store those on my OneDrive or gitHub and also export in JPEG or PNG format to use these in other programmes. Search for a perfect tool ended for me.  

Is this a perfect tool? Not really. It does have its shortcomings e.g. It lacks a repository. So you can draw a component multiple times with the same name. This can cause some maintenance issues in the long run because you might change the in one place but can forget to do so in all other places, rendering your project models inconsistent. However, with $0 tag, this is asking for too much. 

Okay so what's the plan then? Simple. Use the tool to create independent diagrams and models and make some money to eventually buy something like EA Sparx or similar tool. 
If there is a lot of Archimate related work on hand, use Arch instead that has (a limited) support for acresoosutory. But otherwise use the tool as a daily driver till a full blown tool isourchased.
